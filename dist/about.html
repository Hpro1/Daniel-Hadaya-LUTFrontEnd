                <h6>Daniel Hadaya</h6>
                <p>22 year old student. Studying at LUT University. Programming is my passion. I have been working with computers
                    and different electornic devices since I was a kid. Programming helps me to create things that are useful for myself and hopefully 
                    in the future I can create things that are useful for others.
